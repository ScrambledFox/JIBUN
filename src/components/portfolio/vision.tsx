I aim to make our daily lives a smoother experience by linking our day-to-day life with state-of-the-art technologies that can assist us with everyday tasks. I want to provide products for users that aim at reducing the everyday stress of life and do not add to an already growing pile of â€˜techâ€™ in the home, like is happening now with voice assistants or remotes. New technology products need to be aware of the ecosystem they live in and be able to transform themselves to adapt to the needs of their user and work together with other devices with which they share the digital ecosystem. An example of this can now be seen in the IoT environment, where audio devices can work together to create one big speaker."

            "Data and information are better perceived when felt or heard as part of a rich interaction scheme rather than being read from a chart. A great example is haptic interfaces which are led by a digital-context initiative. By bringing data and information into the physical world and the everyday life of the user, I want my designs to provide for a living-data environment, where data and information are not held private but live in full transparency, and only work towards creating value for the user without too complex or unnecessary features. In this space, I think itâ€™s important to stray away from notifications, dings, pings and similar attention-seeking methods, but lay a bigger focus on multi-modal interaction schemes which feel intuitive and seek emotional attachment instead of taking concentration away."

            "Due to the complex and ever-changing world around us, I find it important to design for the future. Designs that will be able to adapt themselves based on how they are being used. By learning from the past and integrating current trends, designs will be better prepared for the future, where smart products feel like an extension of human life and not as a mediator. Experimenting with the latest technologies and using them to create novel concepts will act as a springboard towards radical innovation and out-of-the-box designs which can have true value."
